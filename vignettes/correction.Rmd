# Introduction

The `r Biocpkg("sarlacc")` package is designed to perform error correction on long reads such as those generated with the Oxford Nanpore Technology (ONT).
This is done by considering the unique molecular identifier (UMI) associated with each read.
Reads with the same UMI are groups together and used to construct a consensus sequence, thereby correcting for any sequencing errors unique to each read.
In this manner, we can overcome the higher error rate of ONT data while still retaining the long-read capabilities.

# Setting up sequence data

First, we define the adaptor sequences that should be present on each end of the read sequences.
Here, adaptor 1 contains two stretches of `N`s, corresponding to the sample barcode (first stretch) and UMI (second stretch).
Other IUPAC bases are also supported in situations where adaptors are constructed with some degree of degeneracy.
Of course, it is also possible for adaptor 2 to contain barcodes and UMIs.

```{r}
adaptor1 <- "ACGCAGATCGATCGATNNNNNNNNNNNNCGCGCGAGCTGACTNNNNGCACGACTCTGGTTTTTTTTTTTT"
adaptor2 <- "AAGGCCTTTTCCGACTCATGAA"
```

We also define the specific barcode sequences that could be present in the first stretch of `N`s in `adaptor1`.
Here, we assume that we have three different barcodes in our experiment:

```{r}
all.barcodes <- c("AAGGAATTAAGG", "GGCCAACCGGTT", "CCGGTTGGCCAA")
```

To demonstrate the various `r Biocpkg("sarlacc")` functions in this vignette, we will mock up some data and save it as a FASTQ file.

```{r}
set.seed(1000)
fastq <- tempfile(fileext=".fastq")
ref.seq <- sarlacc:::mockReads(adaptor1=adaptor1, adaptor2=adaptor2, 
    filepath=fastq, all.barcodes=all.barcodes) 
fastq 
```

Needless to say, this is not necessary for users with sequencing data from real experiments.

# Aligning adaptors

## Identifying alignment parameters

Our first task is to align the adaptors to the end of the reads.
We determine suitable alignment parameters using the `tuneAlignment` function.
This will identify the parameter combination that maximizes the separation between the real alignment scores and those for scrambled input sequences.

```{r}
tuning <- tuneAlignment(adaptor1, adaptor2, fastq)
tuning$parameters
```

We confirm that these parameter choices are sensible by verifying the separation in the distribution of scores for the real alignments compared to the scrambled sequences.

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of adaptor alignment scores for the real reads (blue) and scrambled sequences (red) using the tuned alignment parameters. Scores for both adaptors in the optimal orientation are added together to give the combined score for each read."}
real.dist <- density(tuning$scores$reads)
scram.dist <- density(tuning$scores$scrambled)
plot(real.dist, xlim=range(real.dist$x, scram.dist$x),
    ylim=range(real.dist$y, scram.dist$y), col="blue")
lines(scram.dist, col="red")
```

This step is time-consuming but does not need to be routinely performed in every analysis.
It is only necessary to give an intuition for the suitable alignment parameters for a batch of data.

## Performing the alignment

We now align the adaptor sequences to all of the reads using the `adaptorAlign` function^[We are using fixed parameters chosen from one run of the `tuneAlignment`. We could also supply the tuned parameters directly but will not do so for simplicity.].
For speed, the alignment will only consider the 250 bp on either end of the read, under the assumption that the adaptors should occur at the read ends.
This can be further sped up by distributing jobs across multiple cores with the `BPPARAM=` argument.

```{r}
aln.out <- adaptorAlign(adaptor1, adaptor2, fastq, gapOpening=4, gapExtension=1)
colnames(aln.out)
```

The output is a `DataFrame` that contains alignment information for each adaptor.
For example, the `adaptor1` field contains a nested `DataFrame` with alignment scores and positions for `adaptor1` on the read.
It also contains the read subsequences that aligned to the ambiguous regions in `adaptor1` (i.e., the UMI and barcode).

```{r}
aln.out$adaptor1
```

Note that the positions refer to coordinates on a "canonical orientation" of the read where the adaptor 1 occurs at the 5' end.
Reads are marked as being reverse-complemented (if necessary) to match this canonical orientation, to ensure that adaptor 1 and 2 are located on the 5' and 3' ends respectively. 
Whether or not a read sequence was reverse-complemented is indicataed by the `aln.out$reversed` field:

```{r}
summary(aln.out$reversed)
```

# Filtering for adaptor-containing reads

We use the `getAdaptorThresholds` function to choose an appropriate score threshold for the presence of an adaptor.
This involves scrambling the start and end sequences and repeating the alignment, with the aim of choosing a threshold that distinguishes between the real and scrambled scores.
To expedite this process, we only perform this for a random set of 10000 reads.

```{r}
thresh <- getAdaptorThresholds(aln.out, number=1e4)
thresh$threshold1
thresh$threshold2
```

We verify that the thresholds are suitable for adaptor 1:

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of adaptor 1 alignment scores for the real reads (blue) and scrambled sequences (red)."}
real.dist <- density(thresh$scores1$reads)
scram.dist <- density(thresh$scores1$scrambled)
plot(real.dist, xlim=range(real.dist$x, scram.dist$x),
    ylim=range(real.dist$y, scram.dist$y), col="blue")
lines(scram.dist, col="red")
abline(v=thresh$threshold1, col="grey", lty=2)
```

... and for adaptor 2:

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of adaptor 2 alignment scores for the real reads (blue) and scrambled sequences (red)."}
real.dist <- density(thresh$scores2$reads)
scram.dist <- density(thresh$scores2$scrambled)
plot(real.dist, xlim=range(real.dist$x, scram.dist$x),
    ylim=range(real.dist$y, scram.dist$y), col="blue")
lines(scram.dist, col="red")
abline(v=thresh$threshold2, col="grey", lty=2)
```

Based on these thresholds, we retain only those reads that have well-aligned adaptors on both sides^[We'll round the thresholds to fixed values, for simplicity and to simplify reproducibility.].

```{r}
filtered <- filterReads(aln.out, 6, 11)
nrow(filtered)
```

# Demultiplexing reads

Sample barcodes may be present in the adaptor to enable multiplexed sequencing of many samples.
In this case, the first stretch of `N`s represents the barcode so we take `subseq$Sub1`:

```{r}
(obs.barcodes <- filtered$adaptor1$subseq$Sub1)
```

We assign reads back to their sample of origin by aligning the observed barcodes to the references in `all.barcodes`:

```{r}
(debarcoded <- barcodeAlign(obs.barcodes, all.barcodes,
    gapOpening=4, gapExtension=1))
```

The function returns the read sequence at the barcode location, the assigned barcode, its alignment score and the gap to the score of the next-best aligned barcode.
An unambiguous assignment to a single barcode should manifest as a high score and a large gap.
We define thresholds for both of these metrics with `getBarcodeThresholds`: 

```{r}
(barcode.thresh <- getBarcodeThresholds(debarcoded, nmads=2))
```

These thresholds are designed to remove reads with low outlier scores or gaps.
We use a lower `nmads` than the default to be more stringent.
We check that the thresholds are reasonable:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.asp=0.5, fig.cap="Distribution of barcode alignment scores and gaps."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(debarcoded$score, xlab="Barcode alignment score", col="grey80")
abline(v=barcode.thresh["score"], col="red", lty=2)
hist(debarcoded$gap, xlab="Barcode alignment gap", col="grey80")
abline(v=barcode.thresh["gap"], col="red", lty=2)
```

We then filter the reads to only retain those that were unambiguously assigned to a barcode:

```{r}
was.assigned <- debarcoded$score > barcode.thresh["score"] &
    debarcoded$gap > barcode.thresh["gap"]
table(debarcoded$barcode, was.assigned)
```

... and split them into their samples of origin:

```{r}
by.sample <- split(filtered[was.assigned,], debarcoded$barcode[was.assigned])
names(by.sample)
```

The rest of the analysis should proceed on each element of `by.sample` separately, as reads from different samples cannot originate from the same molecule.
For simplicity, we will focus our analysis on the barcode with the most reads:

```{r}
n.per.sample <- unlist(lapply(by.sample, nrow))
my.sample <- by.sample[[which.max(n.per.sample)]]
nrow(my.sample)
```

# Defining read groups 

## Overview

We want to define groups of reads that are likely to have originated from the same cDNA molecule.
This requires that (i) the reads have similar sequences, and (ii) the reads have similar UMIs.
Thus, we group together reads by applying thresholds to  the percentage of read sequence identity and to the edit distances between UMIs.

Note that there is always a balance between specificity and sensitivity when choosing thresholds:

- Thresholds that are conservative (i.e., require high similarity) will ensure that each read group only has a single molecule of origin.
However, each molecule of origin may give rise to multiple read groups.
- More relaxed thresholds will ensure that each molecule of origin yields no more than one read group.
However, reads in the same group may not come from the same molecule.

For the purpose of error correction, more conservative thresholds are generally preferable.
We do not want to use reads from multiple molecules for correction, especially if molecules differ in their base composition due to, e.g., allelic variation.
(On the other hand, more relaxed thresholds may be desirable if the aim is to eliminate PCR duplicates.)

## Based on the read sequence

To satisfy the first requirement, we perform pairwise alignments between all reads using the `groupReads` function.
This is based on the _minimap2_ software, which must be installed on the system.

```{r}
my.sample$reads <- realizeReads(my.sample)
pre.groups <- groupReads(my.sample$reads, truncate=1000)
summary(lengths(pre.groups))
```

For the sake of speed, we only use the first 1 kbp of each read.
This should be sufficient to obtain a rough measure of similarity - grouping on the full read sequence is unnecessary.
We only group reads together if they share at least 70% sequence identity in their first 500 bp.

## Based on the UMI

The second ambiguous stretch on adaptor 1 represents the UMI for each read.
All reads derived from the same transcript molecule should have the same UMI (give or take some differences due to sequencing errors).

```{r}
(my.umis <- my.sample$adaptor1$subseq$Sub2)
```

We apply a threshold on the edit distance between UMI sequences to determine whether two reads have the same UMI.
To obtain an appropriate threshold, we use the `expectedDist` function to compute the distribution of edit distances between (nominally identical) adaptor sequences:

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of edit distances between identical sequences flanking the UMI on adaptor 1."}
# Identify the constant region flanking the UMI on adaptor 1. 
substr(adaptor1, 47, 50)

# Obtaining the aligned read sequence for a sample of 1000 reads.
chosen <- sample(nrow(aln.out), min(nrow(aln.out), 1000))
(constants <- extractSubseq(aln.out[chosen,], subseq1=list(starts=47, ends=50)))

# Computing the expected distance.
edist <- expectedDist(constants$adaptor1$Sub1)
hist(edist, xlab="Edit distances", col="grey80")
```

... and we set the threshold to the median edit distance (or 1, if the median is less than zero):

```{r}
(ethresh <- max(1, median(edist)))
```

We group the UMIs for reads _within_ each level of `pre.groups`:

```{r}
groups <- umiGroup(my.umis, threshold1=ethresh, groups=pre.groups)
summary(lengths(groups))
```

If a second UMI is present (e.g., on the other adaptor), these can be handled by obtaining the subsequence from `my.sample$adaptor2` repeating the `expectedDist` step.
The second set of sequences and threshold can then be supplied as additional arguments to `umiGroup`.

# Performing error correction

We perform multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for each read group using the `r Biocpkg("muscle")` package.
For large data sets, this is often the most time-consuming step and can be parallelized with `BPPARAM`.

```{r}
msa.out <- multiReadAlign(my.sample$reads, groups)

# Peeking at the largest MSA.
by.size <- order(lengths(msa.out$alignments), decreasing=TRUE)
lapply(msa.out$alignments[by.size[1]], subseq, 1, 70) 
```

We create consensus sequences from these MSAs, representing the error-corrected sequence.
The quality scores are constructed from the qualities of the individual read sequences.
Higher consensus qualities for a position indicate that many reads are in agreement.

```{r}
cons.out <- consensusReadSeq(msa.out)
cons.out
```

This can be saved to a FASTQ file with `writeXStringSet` for further analyses.

# Session information

sessionInfo()
